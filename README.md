## Data Structure Final Project
I decided to make a File Explorer because I wanted to demonstrate how data structures are in our daily lives sometimes implicitly.
## What tools/techniques did I use?
 - DefaultMutableTreeNode 
	 - This library is used to represent a file explorer structure visualy
 - JTree
	 - This library is also used in conjunction with DefaultMutableTreeNode to visualzy the tree, but in this case, JTree is the component that we add to the panel
 - Composite Design Pattern
	 - This is very helpful to organize the classes that I'll be needing, this design pattern is used when we want to have a components as childs of a parent component but those childs can be either other type of component  or the same type as the parent

## How to use it?
This was developed using intellij, just clone the repository and compile all files and run the main class [FileExplorerMain](https://github.com/S4ND1X/DataStructuresFinalProject/blob/master/src/MainPrueba.java)
